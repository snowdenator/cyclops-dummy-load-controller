Cyclops Pedal Power dummy load controller.

This is an ESP32 breakout board with 6 high current MOSFET channels, to provide variable load to 6 pedal powered generator sets, for use in green energy demonstrations.

See https://en-gb.facebook.com/CyclopsPedalPower/ for some of the awesome work they do.
